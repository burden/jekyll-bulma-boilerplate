```

### Contact Page

The contact page uses Formspree.io by default, unless deploying to Netlify.

Some things to consider
- 100 free submissions per month
- Upon submission, it will Redirects you to thank you page (see thanks.html)
- No registration required

When deploying to Netlify, the blog will automatically integrate with Netlify Forms. If you still prefer to use Formspree.io, simply change the `site.contact.page.service` block to `formspree`

If you don't have access to `rake` or you don't care to obfuscate your email address, you can choose to display your email in plaintext by inputing your address in the `site.contact.email-plain` block.

  #### Wait, what happens when I click that button?

  Good question. Here's what it will do...

  1. Netlify will clone the git repository of this project into your Github account. This action will require your permission from Github, and of course a Netlify account. 
  2. Netlify will then create a new site for you, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
  3. Enjoy your new website ðŸŽ‰
